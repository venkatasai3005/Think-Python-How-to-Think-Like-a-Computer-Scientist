A crucial feature of programming languages is the ability to work with variables. A variable is a name that represents a value.
Assignments in Python create variables and assign them values. For instance:

message = 'And now for something completely different'

n = 17

pi = 3.1415926535897932

In these examples, we create three variables: message holding a string, n with an integer, and pi containing an approximate value of Ï€.

On paper, variables are often represented by their names with an arrow pointing to their values, forming a state diagram. It illustrates the state of each variable.

The type of a variable is determined by the type of the value it holds:

type(message) returns <type 'str'> for a string.

type(n) returns <type 'int'> for an integer.

type(pi) returns <type 'float'> for a floating-point number.
