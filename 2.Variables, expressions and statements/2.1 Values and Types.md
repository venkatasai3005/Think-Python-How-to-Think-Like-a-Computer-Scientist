In programming, values are fundamental elements that a program works with, such as numbers or letters. Values can belong to different types; for example, 2 is an integer, and 'Hello, World!' is a string, which is identifiable by the quotation marks.

You can determine the type of a value in Python using the type() function. For instance:

type('Hello, World!') returns <type 'str'> because it's a string.

type(17) returns <type 'int'> because it's an integer.

type(3.2) returns <type 'float'> since it's a floating-point number.

Values like '17' and '3.2,' although they resemble numbers, are treated as strings when enclosed in quotation marks.

However, be cautious when using commas in large numbers like 1,000,000 because Python interprets this as a comma-separated sequence of integers, resulting in (1, 0, 0). This demonstrates a semantic error, where the code doesn't produce an error message but doesn't behave as expected.
