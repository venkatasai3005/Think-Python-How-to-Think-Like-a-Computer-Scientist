In Python, you generally can't perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the strings appear to represent numbers. The following operations are not allowed:

'2' - '1'

'eggs' / 'easy'

'third' * 'a charm'

The + operator works with strings, but it performs string concatenation, which joins the strings end-to-end. For example:


first = 'throat'

second = 'warbler'

print(first + second)

The output of this program is 'throatwarbler'.

The * operator also works on strings and performs string repetition. For example, 'Spam' * 3 results in 'SpamSpamSpam'. When using * with strings, one of the operands must be a string, and the other must be an integer.

While this use of + and * makes sense by analogy with addition and multiplication, there is an important difference. Integer addition has a property that string concatenation does not have. Can you think of what that property might be? Integer addition is commutative, meaning the order of the operands doesn't affect the result (e.g., 3 + 4 is the same as 4 + 3). String concatenation, however, is not commutative; the order of the strings matters (e.g., 'first' + 'second' is different from 'second' + 'first').
