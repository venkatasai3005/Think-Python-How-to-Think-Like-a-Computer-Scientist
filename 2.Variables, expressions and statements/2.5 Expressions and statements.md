An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators. It can be a single value or a variable on its own, or it can be a more complex combination, like an arithmetic expression. Here are some examples of legal expressions:

17: A single value.
x: A variable (assuming x has been assigned a value).

x + 17: An arithmetic expression combining a variable and a value.

A statement, on the other hand, is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. In this context, we have encountered two types of statements: the print statement and the assignment statement.

Technically, an expression can also be considered a statement, but it's simpler to think of them as separate concepts. The crucial distinction is that an expression has a value, while a statement does not.
