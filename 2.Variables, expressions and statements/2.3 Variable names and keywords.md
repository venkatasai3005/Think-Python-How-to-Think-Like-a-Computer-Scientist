Programmers choose meaningful variable names to document the purpose of the variable. Variable names can be as long as needed, containing letters and numbers, but they must begin with a letter. While using uppercase letters is legal, it's advisable to start variable names with lowercase letters for convention.

The underscore character, '_', is often used in multi-word variable names, like 'my_name' or 'airspeed_of_unladen_swallow.'

Using illegal variable names results in syntax errors. For example:

76trombones = 'big parade' is illegal because it doesn't start with a letter.

more@ = 1000000 is illegal because it contains an illegal character, '@.'

class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy' is illegal because 'class' is a Python keyword.

In Python, keywords are reserved words used for the structure of the program and cannot be used as variable names. Python 2 has 31 keywords, while Python 3 has 30 keywords, as 'exec' is no longer a keyword in Python 3.

Keep a list of keywords handy in case you encounter naming issues with your variables.
