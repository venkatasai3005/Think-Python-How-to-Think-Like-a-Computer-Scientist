Operators in Python are special symbols that perform various computations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The values the operators work on are called operands. Here are some common operators and examples of their use:

+ performs addition: 20 + 32
+ 
- performs subtraction: hour - 1
- 
* performs multiplication: hour * 60
* 
/ performs division: minute / 60

** performs exponentiation: 5 ** 2

() controls the order of operations: (5 + 9) * (15 - 7)
In Python, the caret (^) is not used for exponentiation; it is a bitwise operator called XOR. The book does not cover bitwise operators, but you can learn about them at the provided link.

Python 2 has some nuances with division. For instance, when dividing two integers, it performs floor division, rounding down to the nearest integer:


minute = 59

result = minute / 60  # In Python 2, this is 0

Python 3 introduces the // operator for floor division, and the result is a float if either of the operands is a floating-point number:


minute = 59

result = minute / 60.0  # In Python 3, this is 0.98333333333333328

This distinction between division behavior is crucial to understand when working with different Python versions.
