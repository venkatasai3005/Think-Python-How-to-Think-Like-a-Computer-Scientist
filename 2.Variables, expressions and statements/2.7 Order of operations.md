In Python, the order of evaluation in expressions is determined by operator precedence, following mathematical conventions. To remember these rules, you can use the acronym PEMDAS:

Parentheses: Have the highest precedence and allow you to control the order of evaluation. For example, 2 * (3 - 1) evaluates to 4, and (1 + 1) ** (5 - 2) evaluates to 8. You can also use parentheses to improve the readability of an expression, such as (minute * 100) / 60.

Exponentiation: Has the next highest precedence. For example, 2 ** 1 + 1 evaluates to 3, and 3 * 1 ** 3 evaluates to 3, not 27.

Multiplication and Division: Have the same precedence, which is higher than Addition and Subtraction, also with the same precedence. So, 2 * 3 - 1 results in 5, not 4, and 6 + 4 / 2 results in 8, not 5.

Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except for exponentiation). For instance, in the expression degrees / 2 * pi, division is performed first, and the result is then multiplied by pi. To divide by 2Ï€, you can use parentheses or write degrees / (2 * pi).

It's not always necessary to remember the rules of precedence for all operators. If there's any doubt, you can use parentheses to make the order of evaluation explicit and avoid potential confusion in complex expressions.
