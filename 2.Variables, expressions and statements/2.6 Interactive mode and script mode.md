In Python, working in interactive mode allows you to test pieces of code before incorporating them into a script. However, there are differences between interactive and script modes.

In interactive mode, you can perform calculations and see immediate results. For instance:


>>> miles = 26.2

>>> miles * 1.61

42.182

The first line assigns a value to miles, but it doesn't display anything. The second line is an expression, so the interpreter evaluates it and shows the result.

In script mode, expressions alone don't display their results. For instance:


miles = 26.2

print(miles * 1.61)

In this case, the script will not output anything unless you use the print function to explicitly display the result. This behavior can be initially confusing.

A script typically contains a sequence of statements. When executed, results are displayed one at a time as the statements run. For example:


print(1)

x = 2

print(x)

The output will be:


1

2

For the exercise:

In the Python interpreter:

Type 5: It doesn't display the result.

Type x = 5: It assigns the value 5 to the variable x.

Type x + 1: It computes 5 + 1 but doesn't display the result.

In a script:

If you put these statements in a script, they won't produce any output.

To see the output, modify the script as follows:

print(5)

x = 5

print(x + 1)

When you run this script, it will display the values as follows:

Copy code
5
6
