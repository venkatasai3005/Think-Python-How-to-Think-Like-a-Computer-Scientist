A function in programming is a named set of instructions that performs a specific task. When defining a function, you specify its name and the sequence of statements it should execute. Later, you can use this function by calling it with a specific argument. For example, when you call the type() function with the argument 32, it returns the type of the argument, which is int. In this context, we say the function "takes" an argument and "returns" a result, which is known as the return value.
