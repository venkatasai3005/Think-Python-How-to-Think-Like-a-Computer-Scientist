In Python, the math module provides various mathematical functions and constants. To use this module, you need to import it with the import math statement. The math module contains functions and variables related to mathematics.

For example, you can use functions like math.log10() to calculate the logarithm of a number, math.sin() to compute the sine of an angle in radians, and math.pi to access the constant for pi.

Here's a brief summary:

Import the math module with import math.
Use dot notation to access functions and constants from the math module.
Example: ratio = signal_power / noise_power, decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio), height = math.sin(radians).
To work with trigonometric functions, remember that they typically expect angles in radians. You can convert degrees to radians using radians = degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi.
You can access the constant pi using math.pi.
These functions and constants provided by the math module are useful for various mathematical calculations and operations.
