Semantic errors are the third type of programming error. When a program contains a semantic error, it will execute without error messages but won't produce the expected results. Instead, it performs an unintended action, precisely what you instructed it to do, not what you wanted it to do. Identifying semantic errors can be challenging because it involves analyzing the program's output to deduce its actual behavior.
