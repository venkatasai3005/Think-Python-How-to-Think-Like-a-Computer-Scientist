Python requires correct syntax for program execution; otherwise, it issues error messages. Syntax pertains to a program's structure and its associated rules. For instance, parentheses must match, as in (1 + 2), while 8) is a syntax error.

Unlike human readers who can overlook syntax errors, Python is less forgiving. A single syntax error results in a program termination and error message. Therefore, early in your programming journey, expect to invest significant time in identifying and resolving syntax errors. With experience, you'll make fewer errors and detect them more swiftly.
