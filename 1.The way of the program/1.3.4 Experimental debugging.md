Debugging is a crucial skill in programming, akin to detective work and experimental science. It involves inferring the causes of issues in your code and making hypotheses about potential solutions. If your hypothesis is accurate, you move closer to a functional program; if not, you generate a new one. This process is encapsulated by Sherlock Holmes' quote: "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." For some, programming and debugging are intertwined; you start with a working program and iteratively debug it as you make small modifications. Even complex systems like Linux had humble beginnings as simple programs. Subsequent chapters will delve deeper into debugging and programming practices.
