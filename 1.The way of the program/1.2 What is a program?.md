A program is essentially a set of instructions that dictate how a particular computation should be carried out. This computation could be mathematical, such as solving equations or finding polynomial roots, or it could involve symbolic operations, like searching and replacing text or even compiling a program.

Although programming languages may have different syntax and features, they typically share a core set of instructions, which include:

1.Input: Obtaining data from sources like the keyboard, files, or devices.

2.Output: Displaying data on screens or transmitting it to files or other devices.

3.Math: Executing basic mathematical operations such as addition and multiplication.

4.Conditional Execution: Evaluating certain conditions and executing corresponding code.

5.Repetition: Performing actions iteratively, often with some variation.

In essence, nearly all programs, no matter how intricate, are constructed using these fundamental instructions. Therefore, programming can be seen as the process of breaking down complex tasks into smaller and more manageable subtasks, eventually addressing them with these basic instructions. While this concept might appear somewhat abstract, it will become clearer when we delve into the discussion of algorithms.
