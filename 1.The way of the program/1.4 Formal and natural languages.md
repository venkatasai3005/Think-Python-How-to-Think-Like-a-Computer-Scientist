Natural languages, like English or Spanish, evolve naturally and are not designed. Formal languages, such as mathematical notation or chemical representations, are deliberately created for specific purposes. Programming languages are a subset of formal languages used for computation.

Formal languages have strict rules, focusing on token correctness and structural integrity. Tokens are the basic elements (e.g., words, numbers), and structure is how tokens are arranged. For instance, "3+ = 3$6" contains invalid tokens, while "3+ = 3" has valid tokens but an invalid structure.

Parsing is the process of understanding the structure of a sentence or statement, leading to semantics comprehension.

Differences between natural and formal languages include ambiguity (common in natural languages but minimal in formal ones), redundancy (natural languages are more verbose), and literalness (formal languages convey exact meanings).

Reading formal languages like programs requires careful parsing, attention to structure, and scrutiny of details due to their density and reliance on syntax.
