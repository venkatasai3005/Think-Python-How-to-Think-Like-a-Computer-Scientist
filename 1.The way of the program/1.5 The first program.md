The "Hello, World!" program is traditionally the first program written in a new programming language, and in Python 2, it's written as:

python

print 'Hello, World!'

The print statement in Python displays text on the screen. The quotation marks indicate the text to be displayed, but they don't appear in the output.

In Python 3, the syntax is slightly different, using parentheses:

python

print('Hello, World!')

This change signifies that print is a function, which will be discussed in Chapter 3.

Throughout this book, the Python 2 version will be used for the print statement, and if you're using Python 3, you'll need to make minor adjustments.
