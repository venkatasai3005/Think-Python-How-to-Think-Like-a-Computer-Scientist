Programming is prone to errors, amusingly known as "bugs," and the task of locating these issues is called "debugging." There are three main types of errors in programming:

1.Syntax Errors: These arise from code violations, like missing punctuation or typos. They are detected by the compiler or interpreter and must be fixed before running the program.

2.Runtime Errors: These occur while the program is running due to unexpected conditions, potentially leading to crashes or erratic behavior.

3.Semantic Errors: These subtle errors result in code that runs without issues but doesn't produce the expected results, making them challenging to detect.

Differentiating these errors is crucial for efficient debugging.
