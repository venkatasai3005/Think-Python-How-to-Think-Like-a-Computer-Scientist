The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist, which involves blending elements from mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Computer scientists use formal languages to represent computations, design systems, and analyze complex behaviors. The most crucial skill for a computer scientist is problem-solving, which encompasses formulating problems, creatively devising solutions, and communicating them effectively. Learning to program is an excellent way to enhance problem-solving skills, making this chapter "The way of the program" essential for both acquiring programming expertise and using it to achieve broader goals.
